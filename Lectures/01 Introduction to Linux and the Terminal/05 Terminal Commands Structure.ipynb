    "   - Options (or flags)\n",
    "   - Arguments\n",

    "3. **Syntax Conventions**: We discussed important conventions, including:\n",
    "   - Case sensitivity\n",
    "   - Handling spaces and special characters\n",
    "   - Using quotes and escape characters\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Command Execution and Output**: We looked at how to execute commands and interpret their output, including understanding error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Getting Help**: We learned several methods to find help and information about commands:\n",
    "   - Using `--help` option\n",
    "   - Accessing man pages with the `man` command\n",
    "   - Using the `info` command for more detailed documentation\n",
